Autopilot

This is a project to replace the analog electronics inside an old autopilot 
for sail boats (Tillerpilot 2500) with an Arduino based system. This makes
it possible to control the boat with short range radio modules, such as xbee 
(ZigBee) and btbee (Bluetooth). Finally we will be able to control the boat
with a smartphone. Bond would be jealous.
